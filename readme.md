# ttt_cge_launcher
Stands for "Concussion Grenade Launcher". Meant to be a weapon that launched discombob grenades that explode on impact, messing with players accordingly.

One thing led to another and I ended up trying to apply some vector field shenanigans to *try* to make this more configurable than it should've been.

This thing sucks and must be rewritten at some point.
